/*
 * You are working as a software developer for a bank that wants to create a secure and flexible account management system. The bank requires all account types to follow a common structure but have different behaviors based on their type. To achieve this, the system uses an Account interface, which defines methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and calculating the total balance. The system supports different account types, including SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount, which implement the Account interface and define their own balance rules. The SavingsAccount includes an interestRate, which is added to the balance when calculating the totalBalance, whereas the CurrentAccount does not apply interest but may allow overdraft transactions. Additionally, the bank system follows association by linking accounts with a Customer class, which holds personal details and manages multiple accounts, ensuring a well-structured and efficient account management system.
